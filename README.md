I’m building a lightweight and distraction-free personal Kanban board for macOS using Swift and SwiftUI. My goal is to manage tasks across up to 3 projects inside one unified view without clutter. I want you to act as my senior macOS engineer and give me:

A suggested architecture for the app (data models, state management, persistence).

A SwiftUI layout with three main columns (Backlog, In Progress, Done) that works on macOS and supports multiple projects displayed together.

A simple UI mechanism for filtering tasks by project without hiding tasks from other projects entirely.

Drag-and-drop code for moving tasks between columns.

Minimal styling that prioritizes clarity over visual flair.

Local JSON or AppStorage-based persistence for now.

A short list of improvements I can add later (sync, keyboard shortcuts, reminders, etc).

Assume I’m using Xcode and plan to expand later. Please provide Swift code files with filenames and explain how they connect so I can paste them in directly.
